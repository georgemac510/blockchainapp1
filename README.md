### The McKurz Decentralized Exchange (DEX) allows users to trade digital assets on the Sepolia Ethereum blockchain for Sepolia ETH tokens. This DEX ensures self-custody of your tokens, meaning the exchange smart contract holds your tokens only while you have active orders. Your tokens remain securely held in the smart contract until you withdraw them, offering a safer alternative to centralized exchanges where you relinquish control of your assets and must trust the exchange to facilitate trades and withdrawals. There have been instances of centralized exchanges failing to return customer assets, a risk mitigated by using a DEX.

#### To access the McKurz DEX and make trades, you need a Metamask or Phantom wallet funded with Sepolia ETH. If you need to fund your wallet, Quicknode and Alchemy both offer Sepolia faucets where you can obtain Sepolia ETH.
